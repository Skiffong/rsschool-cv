    I'm an **engineer-avionic** for modern aircraft as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. 
Coding for me it's just a hobbie but I can’t stand still because I’m used to constantly evolving and learning new things.
I also want to make my hobby an additional source of income. 
*Of course I’m self-taught*.
1. There are my skills in coding: 
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * SCSS
  * BEM
  * GULP
  * JavaScript
  * jQuery

2. And some example of code: 
  ```
  function converttoArabic(str) {
  if (!/^[IVXLC]+$/i.test(str)) throw new Error("invalid expression");
  return str
    .toUpperCase()
    .split("")
    .reduce(function (r, v, i, arr) {
      const [a, b, c] = [
        numbers[arr[i]],
        numbers[arr[i + 1]],
        numbers[arr[i + 2]],
      ];
      if (b && c && a <= b && b < c) throw new Error("invalid expression");
      return b > a ? r - a : r + a;
    }, 0);
  }
  ```

I have no real experience working as a programmer, but [here](https://skiffong.github.io/Desire/) my pet-project.

I am fluent in English with an excellent understanding of technical documentation and a good letter. Spoken English is a little behind because of the chatter of constant practice.
